## Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Real-time Tracking and Fare Estimation Feature

### Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a real-time tracking and fare estimation feature in a ride-hailing app designed for auto-rickshaws in tier-2 and tier-3 cities in India. This functionality aims to provide users with a seamless experience, allowing them to view their ride's location in real-time and get an accurate estimate of the fare based on distance and current traffic conditions.

### Goals
1. Enhance user experience by providing real-time tracking of rides.
2. Offer accurate fare estimation based on distance and traffic conditions.
3. Ensure safety and reliability through verified local drivers.

### Scope
- Support for auto-rickshaws in the initial phase.
- Integration of GPS for real-time location tracking.
- Implement algorithms for fare estimation based on distance and traffic.
- User interface updates to reflect real-time information.

### Functional Requirements

#### Real-time Tracking
1. **GPS Integration**:
   - The app must integrate with GPS technology to track the location of the auto-rickshaw and the user's current location.
   - Update the location every 5 seconds and display it on the userâ€™s app interface.

2. **Map Interface**:
   - Use a map service (e.g., Google Maps) to show real-time tracking.
   - Allow users to zoom in/out and pan around the map.
   - Highlight the route taken by the driver.

3. **Notifications**:
   - Send push notifications to the user when the driver is en route, arriving, and any significant change of ETA.

#### Fare Estimation
1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Calculate the distance from the pickup point to the destination using map services.
   - Factor in real-time traffic data to give a more accurate fare estimate.

2. **Fare Structure**:
   - Define a base fare, per kilometer charge, and additional charges (e.g., night surcharge) within the app, selected based on city norms.
   - Implement fare estimation calculations that combine distance, time, and additional charges to provide a comprehensive fare estimate.

3. **Display Fare Estimates**:
   - Show estimated fare to the user before booking the ride and upon request during the ride.
   - Include disclaimers about the potential for fare changes due to real-time traffic and detours.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**:
   - The app should provide real-time updates within 5 seconds.
   - The fare estimator should provide results under 2 seconds after entering a destination.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Ensure the system can scale to include cabs and bike taxis in future versions while maintaining data accuracy.

3. **Usability**:
   - Ensure a user-friendly interface to access real-time tracking and fare estimation.
   - Provide clear instructions and visuals to guide users through the process.

4. **Security**:
   - Ensure that user data related to location and payment details are securely managed and encrypted.
